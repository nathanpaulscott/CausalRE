# CausalRE
A project for Casual Relation Extraction from Text

## Summary
This repo contains the research reports and code for an honours project on investigating causal triplet extraction from natural language text.  
The literature review gives an overview of the problem and modelling techniques.  
The Dissertation describes the final research and code which focussed on looking into an approach derived from discriminative BERT based NER-RE methods.  
The code needs to be run with 16 to 40GB of GPU RAM depending on configurations.
