He called <S2> the WannaCry attack </S2> a reckless attack that caused `` <S0> havoc and destruction </S0> '' by locking vital information away from users , including hospital networks . `` We believe now we have the evidence to support this assertion , '' Bossert said . `` It 's very difficult to do when you 're looking for individual hackers . In this case , we found a concerted effort . '' In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday , Bossert wrote that after careful investigation , Washington can say that Pyongyang is `` directly responsible '' for the WannaCry virus . Bossert called the attack in which victims received ransom demands to unlock their computers `` cowardly , costly and careless .

There are no free passes for foreign , state-sponsored criminal behavior , Assistant Attorney General McCord told reporters at a press conference .
