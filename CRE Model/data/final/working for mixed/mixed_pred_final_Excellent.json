There are no free passes for foreign , state-sponsored criminal behavior , Assistant Attorney General McCord told reporters at a press conference . When <S0> Yahoo first disclosed the breach in September </S0> , the company attributed the attack to a state-sponsored actor , a claim that some security experts found questionable at the time . Subsequent reports found that <S2> the Yahoo database was sold a number of times </S2> , suggesting a criminal profit motive rather than intelligence gathering .",

Dubbed Operation Cloud Hopper , <S2> the cyber-espionage campaign has been uncovered by security researchers at PwC , BAE Systems , and the UK 's National Cyber Security Centre </S2> . The researchers say the campaign is `` highly likely '' to be the work of the China-based APT10 hacking group . The group has been focusing on espionage since 2009 and has evolved from targeting US defence firms as well as the technology and telecommunications sectors to targeting organisations in multiple industries across the globe . The group was behind the Poison Ivy malware family and has evolved its operations to include using custom tools capable of compromising high volumes of data from organisations and their customers , and stealthily moving it around the world .",

In this case , we found a concerted effort .
