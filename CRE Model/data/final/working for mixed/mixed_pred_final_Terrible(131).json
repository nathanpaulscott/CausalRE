TUEs allow athletes to take normally-prohibited substances where they 're required , such as when they suffer from an illness . Sebastian Coe , an Olympic champion and current IAAF president , said the organization apologized to athletes affected by the hack , which dated back to at least February 21 .

The attacks were found to have breached a wide variety of secret data ranging from personal data to intellectual property , in what the report described as `` one of the largest ever sustained global cyber espionage campaigns '' . The group behind the attacks , named APT10 , was found to have used custom malware and `` spear phishing '' techniques to target managed outsourced IT service companies as stepping stones into the systems of an `` unprecedented web '' of victims according to the report 's authors . The report 's authors included the National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC ) and cyber units at defence group BAE systems and accountancy firm PwC . The gang were found to have used the companies as a way into their customers ' systems from 2016 onwards , although there is evidence to suggest they had first employed the tactics from as early 2014 . PwC cyber security Partner Richard Horne told the Press Association the extent of the malicious campaign was still unclear .",

In your browser address bar , look out for `` not secure '' to the left of the address . Fortune reports that in the future , Google will present this warning and indicate unprotected sites more aggressively with a red triangle . According to Satnam Narang , Senior Security Response Manager at Norton by Symantec , here 's how the Gmail phishing scam works : You 'll see an email in your inbox from one of your contacts who has already been hacked . The email looks like it contains an attachment . But if you look closely , as this Twitter user did , you 'll notice that the image preview for the attachment looks slightly fuzzy . This is because there is n't actually an attachment , just an image designed to look like one .",

We regret , however , that information about some of our patients may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party due to an email phishing incident . On January 24 , 2017 , the medical school learned that some of its employees responded to a Dec 2 , 2016 , phishing email , believing it to be a legitimate request . A phishing email is designed to look like a legitimate email but tricks the recipient into taking some action , such as providing login credentials . Upon learning of the incident , we secured the email accounts and began an investigation . The investigation could not rule out that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to some employees ' email accounts . We conducted a detailed review of the employees ' email accounts and confirmed that some of the emails contained patient information , which may have included names , birth dates , medical record numbers , diagnosis and treatment information , other clinical information , and in some instances Social Security numbers .",

At this time is currently unknown how this ransomware is distributed . This is the first time that we have seen these types of threats actually being carried out by a ransomware infection . The good news is that a method has been discovered that allows victims to decrypt their files for free . Jigsaw Ransomware is serious about its threats ... It is not the first time that we have seen ransomware threaten to delete files , but this is the first time that one has actually carried out its threats . The Jigsaw Ransomware deletes files every 60 minutes and when the program is restarted . Every hour , the Jigsaw Ransomware will delete a file on your computer and increment a counter .",

However , from the viewpoint of a private citizen whose entire database has been held hostage by vicious hackers , not paying a ransom is hardly an option . According to the FBI ' s own statistics , ransomware attacks are spreading like virus in the US alone , with a spike as alarming as $ 209 million in damages in the first three months of 2016 . When you look at it , the reasons behind the spread of ransomware are quite easy to understand . The malicious coding can be acquired by anyone with an internet connection for as little as a hundred dollars on the Deep Web , the psychological pressure over losing one ' s important data almost always ends up in a successful heist and the current law enforcement system can and does very little to prevent the situation from going out of control .

It sounds too good to be true , and that ' s because it is ! Here ' s what the message looks like : The suffix .ML visible in the link above stands for Mali , which started giving away domain names for free a few years ago . ( It ' s not the only country to do this , but it claims to have been the first African nation to do so . ) The use of a free domain isn ' t always a reliable indicator of a scam , not least because even mainstream-looking .COM domains can be had for a dollar these days , but you don ' t need the link to make you suspicious in this case .",

If you are using a Windows 10 Mobile that does not support Windows Hello , your are likely using a pin to secure your device . The pin can be easily set-up from Windows 10 Mobile ' s Sign-in Options page in the Settings app . However , there ' s an interesting issue with this system . That ' s because you can easily remove the pin from the device without having to verify the current pin that ' s set . For instance , if your pin is 2017 and someone else gets access to your phone , they can simply remove it without having to verify the pin . This , however , isn ' t the case when you try to change the pin as the OS will ask you to verify the existing pin first .",

The insurer polled over 1000 adults over the age of 45 in the latest update to its long-running Real Retirement Report . Further , 6 % said they had actually fallen victim to such an online attack , amounting to around 1.2 million adults . Some 22 % more people it surveyed had been targeted by email rather than phone-based fraud . Aviva claimed this is important because the government is currently consulting on whether to ban cold calling in a bid to hit pension scammers . It highlights the need for regulators to address digital fraud at the same time , the insurer claimed . Over 20.6 million UK adults over 45 have been targeted by an email scam , versus nearly 17m via the telephone , Aviva calculated .",

The flaw that allows this to happen is found in a custom version of GoAhead , a lightweight embedded web server that has been fitted into the devices . This and other vulnerabilities have been found by security researcher Pierre Kim , who tested one of the branded cameras the Wireless IP Camera ( P2P ) WIFICAM . The extensive list of devices affected by the flaw in the custom embedded web server can be found here , and includes 1250+ camera models from over 300 vendors , including D-Link , Foscam , Logitech , Netcam , and Polaroid . This vulnerability allows an attacker to steal credentials , ftp accounts and smtp accounts ( email ) , Kim noted . He also shared a PoC exploit that leverages the flaw to allow an attacker to achieve root shell on the device .",

Today , experts continue to find flaws in popular laser printers , which are putting businesses at risk . Experts at the University Alliance Ruhr recently announced vulnerabilities in laser printers from manufacturers including Dell , HP , Lexmark , Samsung , Brother , and Konica . The flaws could permit print docs to be captured , allow buffer overflow exploits , disclose passwords , or cause printer damage . Up to 60,000 currently deployed printers could be vulnerable , they estimate . When unprotected , printers expose users to several types of attacks , says Jeremiah Grossman , chief of security strategy at SentinelOne . Hackers can use vulnerabilities to capture old printer logs , which may contain sensitive information . They may also use these flaws to establish their foothold in a networked device and move laterally throughout the organization to gather data . Some attackers want to wreak havoc outside a single business . With networked printers under their control , a cybercriminal may use one company 's bandwidth to perform DDoS attacks on other organizations and individuals around the world .",

When payment demands are a few hundred dollars or so , victims may be more inclined to pay the fee . However , the SamSam ransomware is now demanding far more than the average person would be able to raise . Written in C # , SamSam is usually installed after an unpatched , known server vulnerability is exploited .",

The researchers said the same attack would work on the Pepper robot too . After the infection , the robot is shown insulting its audience and demanding to be 'fed ' bitcoin cryptocurrency in order to restore systems back to normal . While a tiny robot making threats might initially seem amusing -- if a little creepy -- the proof-of-concept attack demonstrates the risks associated with a lack of security in robots and how organisations that employ robots could suddenly see parts of their business grind to a halt should they become a victim of ransomware .",

In a paper slated for presentation at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May , McCoy and a team including researchers from the University of California , San Diego ; Princeton University ; Google ; and the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis provide the first detailed account of the ransomware payment ecosystem , from initial attack to cash-out . Key findings include the discovery that South Koreans are disproportionately impacted by ransomware campaigns , with <S0> analysis revealing that <S1> $ 2.5 million of the $ 16 million in ransomware payments tracked by the researchers was paid in South Korea </S1> . The paper 's authors call for additional research to determine the reason that so many South Koreans are victimized and how they can be protected .",

This one group is asking victims to pay 50 Monero 'around $ 17,000' to a Monero address . The group does n't say it will stop the attack but only implies it . Such attacks have first appeared in 2015 and were initially referred to as DDoS-for-Bitcoin after the DD4BTC group that pioneered such tactics . The group would send emails to various companies , threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless they paid a ransom fee .

Financial Fraud Action UK said this was ' largely due to <S2> criminals shifting their methods away from using malware attacks on online banking systems </S2> , which bank security processes identified ' . Increasingly , it said , <S3> fraudsters are focussing on targeting individuals directly </S3> , which is harder for banks to stop . The report said the main ploy used by criminals is the ' impersonation and deception scam ' whereby they pretend to be from a ' legitimate and trusted organisation ' such as a bank , the police , a utility company or a government department . These scams typically involve the fraudster contacting the customer through a phone call , text message or email .",

As reported previously by ZDNet , the bug , dubbed `` KRACK '' -- which stands for Key Reinstallation Attack -- is at heart a fundamental flaw in the way Wi-Fi Protected Access II ( WPA2 ) operates . <S4> The security protocol , an upgrade from WEP , is used to protect and secure communications between everything from our routers , mobile devices , and Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices </S4> , but <S1> there is an issue in the system 's four-way handshake that permits devices with a pre-shared password to join a network </S1> . According to security researcher and academic Mathy Vanhoef , who discovered the flaw , threat actors can leverage the vulnerability to decrypt traffic , hijack connections , perform man-in-the-middle attacks , and eavesdrop on communication sent from a WPA2-enabled device .",

The flaw affects the Credential Security Support Provider ( CredSSP ) protocol , which is used in all instances of Windows ' Remote Desktop Protocol ( RDP ) and Remote Management ( WinRM ) . <S3> The vulnerability , CVE-2018-0886 , could allow remote code execution via a physical or wifi-based Man-in-the-Middle attack </S3> , where <S1> the attacker steals session data , including local user credentials , during the CredSSP authentication process </S1> . Although <S2> Microsoft says the bug has not yet been exploited </S2> , it could cause <S4> serious damage if left unpatched </S4> . <S5> RDP is widely used in enterprise environments </S5> and an attacker who successfully exploits this bug could use it to gain a foothold from which to pivot and escalate . It ' s also popular with small businesses who outsource their IT administration and , needless to say , an attacker with an admin account has all <S0> the aces </S0> .",

A security researcher that goes by the Twitter handle SandboxEscaper , however , decided it would be a good idea to expose a 0-day threat to the world on Twitter , without forewarning Microsoft , and even linked to proof on concept code on GitHub that has since been verified as functional . The language in the original Tweet prevents me from directly embedding it here . SandboxEscaper essentially said , Here is the alpc bug as 0day ... I do n't * * * * ing care about life anymore . Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway ... The official post on the CERT/CC website explains , The Microsoft Windows task scheduler SchRpcSetSecurity API contains a vulnerability in the handling of ALPC , which can allow a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges .

Exploiting the bug Ormandy discovered requires that <S1> an attacker sends a malformed PostScript , PDF , EPS , or XPS file to a victim </S1> . Once the file reaches the Ghostscript interpreter , <S3> the malicious code contained within will execute an attacker 's desired on that machine </S3> . The vulnerability , which has not received a CVE identifier just yet , allows an attacker to take over applications and servers that use vulnerable versions of Ghostscript . At the time of writing , there is no fix available . By far , the most affected projects are the ImageMagick image processing library , but also many Linux distros where this library ships by default .",

With more than 12,000 clients across the world using the company 's services , <S2> it is hard to establish how many customers ' details were exposed in the 'information disclosure vulnerability ' found by security researcher Kristian Erik Hermansen </S2> . When logging into his local bank , which uses Fiserv 's platform , Hermansen learned email alerts for financial transactions were assigned an 'event number ' , which he successfully predicted were distributed in sequence , according to KrebsOnSecurity . Using this knowledge , the researcher was able to directly view alerts set up by another customer by <S1> rewriting the site 's code in his browser and sending a request for an altered event number </S1> . He was able to view the customer 's email address , phone number and bank account number - as well as view and edit alerts they had previously set up .",

There ' s got to be a good reason not to disclose , said Ian Levy , technical director at the NCSC . The default position , the NCSC said , is to disclose those vulnerabilities to the public after fixes have been made . The government will only keep them confidential in rare instances , such as if there ' s an overriding intelligence reason . Levy said withholding release of a bug will require high-level government sign-off . The goal is to prevent cyberattacks like WannaCry , which paralyzed computer systems around the world in May 2017 .",

Including `` .. / '' in a name could result in <S3> directory hopping </S2> . <S1> Post-checkout hooks could then be executed </S3> , potentially causing <S0> all manner of mayhem to ensue on the victim 's system </S0> . Another vulnerability , CVE-2018-11233 , describes a flaw in the processing of pathnames in Git on NTFS-based systems , allowing the reading of memory contents . In a change from normal programming , the vulnerability appears to be cross platform . Fear not , however , because a patch is available . The Git team released the update in 2.13.7 of the popular coding , collaboration and control tool and forward-ported it to versions 2.14.4 , 2.15.2 , 2.16.4 and 2.13.7 .",

A quick recap : In March , CTS Labs released information on a collection of vulnerabilities in AMD 's latest chips that it dubbed `` Ryzenfall . '' These security flaws were said to be present in the most basic aspects of the Ryzen and EPYC processors , and <S5> after <S3> consulting with other researchers </S5> , CTS Labs decided to publish its findings without giving AMD the customary 90-day notice between a vulnerability 's discovery and its public disclosure . Earlier this week , CTS Labs emailed us to express concern about the lack of updates from AMD regarding these vulnerabilities .",

With a specially crafted network request , any user can establish a connection through the Kubernetes application programming interface ( API ) server to a backend server . Once established , an attacker can send arbitrary requests over the network connection directly to that backend . Adding insult to injury , these requests are authenticated with the Kubernetes API server 's Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) credentials . Worse still , `` In default configurations , all users ( authenticated and unauthenticated ) are allowed to perform discovery API calls that allow this escalation . '' So , yes , anyone who knows about this hole can take command of your Kubernetes cluster . Oh , and for the final jolt of pain : `` There is no simple way to detect whether this vulnerability has been used .",

According to security firm Ivanti , an attacker first needs to log into the operating system , but then can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrator privileges . Another vulnerability patched on Tuesday ' CVE-2018-8423 ' was publicly disclosed last month along with sample exploit code . This flaw involves a component shipped on all Windows machines and used by a number of programs , and could be exploited by getting a user to open a specially-crafted file ' such as a booby-trapped Microsoft Office document . KrebsOnSecurity has frequently suggested that Windows users wait a day or two after Microsoft releases monthly security updates before installing the fixes , with the rationale that occasionally buggy patches can cause <S5> serious headaches for users who install them before all the kinks </S4> are </S5> worked </S3> out </S1> .",

Those chips come with changes at the hardware level and should be far more secure against the kind of attacks that Spectre and its ilk have brought to light in recent years .

The bug was easy to exploit , Vermeulen told TechCrunch in an email , and was remotely exploitable if a My Cloud device allows remote access over the internet ' which thousands of devices do .

On Tuesday , Adobe said in a security advisory that the update impacts ColdFusion version 11 , as well as the 2016 and 2018 releases of the web application development platform . In total , six of the security flaws are deemed critical . The first set of vulnerabilities -- CVE-2018-15965 , CVE-2018-15957 , CVE-2018-15958 , and CVE-2018-15959 -- relate to the deserialization of untrusted data . In addition , CVE-2018-15961 is a security flaw which permits unrestricted file uploads in the software , and the final critical bug , CVE-2018-15960 , is described as `` use of a component with a known vulnerability '' which can cause <S3> arbitrary file overwrite </S3> . If exploited , all of the above security flaws can lead to <S2> arbitrary code execution </S2> . Three other bugs in ColdFusion have also been resolved .",

The email came complete with a bogus 'HMRC Transaction Confirmation ' number and a link claiming to be to the Government Gateway , which is used to access online government services . Of course , I would just need to click on the bogus link with my 'credit/debit card ready ' so the criminals at the other end of the link could scam my cards for as much money as possible . At first glance , it may look fairly convincing - the spelling and grammar is pretty good , it contains plenty of official-looking reference numbers and the web links are at least in part quite similar to the genuine articles .

As a result , <S2> WannaCry could worm its way through your network automatically </S2> , potentially leaving you with hundreds or even thousands of scrambled computers in a single attack , even if only one user opened a booby-trapped attachment or downloaded a file from a poisoned website . The crooks behind the SamSam ransomware have also latched onto a rather different approach : instead of trying to reach thousands or tens of thousands of victims around the world with a hard-hitting spam campaign , and squeezing each of them for hundreds or thousands of dollars each , the SamSammers seem to attack one organisation at a time . Indeed , the SamSammers generally keep their hand hidden until they have broken into the network and figured out , using similar techniques to penetration testers , a list of computers they know they can encrypt all at the same time .",

Uncovered by researchers in the Security and Privacy Group at the University of Birmingham , the vulnerability allows an attacker who is on the same network as the victim to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and steal information . The vulnerability lay in the certificate pinning technology , a security mechanism used to prevent impersonation attacks and use of fraudulent certificates by only accepting certificates signed by a single pinned CA root certificate .",

Mozilla has fixed the bugs in Firefox 63 , Firefox ESR 60.3 , and Thunderbird 60.3 respectively . Apart from the critical memory safety bugs , Mozilla also released fixes for several other vulnerabilities affecting Thunderbird .

With phishing simple to carry out but potentially very financially rewarding -- some of the highest profile cyber-attacks of recent years began with a phishing email -- it 's no wonder that newbie hackers want in .

This according to researchers with security shop Exodus Intel , who claim that <S4> CVE-2018-6661 was not fully addressed with either of the two patches McAfee released for it </S4> . The flaw is <S3> an elevation of privilege issue in McAfee 's TrueKey password manager </S3> . An exploit can be carried out on a guest account by side-loading a specially-crafted DLL into True Key that would then <S6> allow for commands and code to be executed with system-level privileges </S6> . McAfee 's summary of the flaw , published on March 30 , lists it as a 'high ' severity issue that was patched in version 4.20.110 - which was released in April . Exodus says that the April release did n't fully fix the bug , however . The researchers explain that <S5> McAfee 's patch only addresses one of the libraries ( SDKLibAdapter ) that would allow the attack to take place </S5> , with another DLL ( NLog logging library ) being left vulnerable to the same side-loading tactic .",

At its essence , phishing is the act of pretending to be someone or something you trust in order to trick you into entering sensitive data like your user name and password . The goal -- of course -- is to take your money . Some of the most common phishing scams are bogus emails purportedly from trustworthy institutions like the U.S.Internal Revenue Service or major banks . The more sophisticated scams are crafted to look very much like a legitimate message from a site you do business with . Many popular phishing scams purport to be from shipping companies , e-commerce companies , social networking websites , financial institutions , tax-preparation companies and some of the world ' s most notable companies , said Norton by Symantec senior security response manager Satnam Narang via email .",

It 's a technique used by the lowliest criminals as part of ransomware campaigns , right up to state-backed hackers because it continues to be such an effective method . In a review of 100 simulated attack campaigns for 48 of its clients , accounting for almost a million individual users , security company MWR Infosecurity found that sending a bogus friend request was the best way to get someone to click on a link -- even when the email was being sent to a work email address . Almost a quarter of users clicked the link to be taken through to a fake login screen , with more than half going on to provide a username and password , and four out of five then going on to download a file .",

Overall , the chip giant fixed five bugs three rated high-severity , and two medium-severity . The most concerning of these bugs is an escalation-of-privilege glitch in Intel ' s PROset/Wireless Wi-Fi software , which is its wireless connection management tool . The vulnerability , CVE-2018-12177 , has a high CVSS score of 7.8 , according to Intel ' s update . <S2> Intel is releasing software updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability </S2> , it said , urging users to update to version 20.90.0.7 or later of the software . The vulnerability , reported by Thomas Hibbert of Insomnia Security , stems from improper directory permissions plaguing the software ' s ZeroConfig service in versions before 20.90.0.7 . The issue could allow an authorized user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access . The other high-severity bug exists in the company ' s System Support Utility for Windows , which offers support for Intel-packed Windows device users .",

Due to <S6> attack </S6> , employees needed to switch to paper charting and <S3> various systems were taken offline immediately </S3> . This fairly quick response limited the ransomware damage and <S1> prevented <S2> the possible data breach </S2> . [ 2 ] According to Karin Janiszewski , director of marketing and public relations for EORH and OVMC , hospitals reacted as soon as possible and , at the moment of writing , they are already using the computer network . On the following Saturday , Karin Janiszewski stated : There has been no patient information breach . The hospitals are switching to paper charting to ensure patient data protection . We have redundant security , so <S7> the attack was able to get through the first layer but not the second layer </S7> .",

Details leaked by City of Atlanta employees during the ransomware attack , including screenshots of the demand message posted on city computers , indicated that Samsam-based malware was used . A Samsam variant was used in a number of ransomware attacks on hospitals in 2016 , with <S0> attackers using vulnerable Java Web services to gain entry in several cases </S0> . In more recent attacks , including one on the health industry companies Hancock Health and Allscripts , other methods were used to gain access , including Remote Desktop Protocol hacks that gave the attackers direct access to Windows systems on the victims ' networks .

In fact , he admitted Wednesday at the monthly meeting of the Toronto Area Security Klatch ( TASK ) , a group of infosec pros and students , that a headhunter he consulted flatly told him to decline the offer .

The research team at Check Point found that one of the pre-installed malwares was Slocker , a mobile ransomware , that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES ) encryption algorithm to encrypt all files on the device and demand ransom in return for their decryption key . The most notable rough adnet which targeted the devices is the Loki Malware .",

Rick Holland , VP of strategy at Digital Shadows , joined this week ' s Hacker Tracker to highlight how cybercriminals are utilizing the dark web to support their tax fraud campaigns . Earlier this year , the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that there was a reduction in the number of fraudulent tax returns identified between 2013 and 2015 . On the other hand , around that same time the IRS released data showing that phishing and malware incidents in the 2016 tax season increased by 400 percent . Noting that the number of identified fraudulent returns was not indicative of the overall levels of tax fraud occurring , <S2> Digital Shadows set out to reconcile two very different perspectives </S1> on the same problem </S2> .",

While seven of the 13 apps obviously focused on Turkish-speaking users , the rest targeted users from across the world . Stefanko says he reported all 13 apps to Google 's security team , who removed them from the Play Store last week . The modus operandi of all these apps was the same . <S2> The app would then collect the user 's login details , send them to a remote server , and show a login error </S2> . <S1> The error would appear every time the user tried to authenticate </S1> , and after a certain number of login attempts , <S0> the error would change </S0> , and ask the user to visit the official Instagram site instead and authorize the app from there . When the user visited the Instagram homepage , he would see a notification from Instagram letting him know that someone has accessed his account . From this point on , if victims do n't change their passwords , the crook would use the victim 's Instagram account to like images or follow other accounts .",

The microelectromechanical systems - or MEMS accelerometers - that the research team found to contain these vulnerabilities - are sensors used in various devices to measure acceleration or velocity , and then report those readings to a microprocessor . `` What we looked at was the ability to trick these sensors into delivering false readings to the microprocessor by using sound waves , '' he says in an interview with Information Security Media Group . `` What medical devices contain these sensors is still an open question . The main hazard of this sound wave vulnerability is the threat to the integrity and availability of the sensor , he explains .",

They do n't seem too critical on their own , but when combined , they allow attackers to create hidden administrative accounts and execute malicious PHP code on the underlying server . The exploit takes advantage of some false assumptions made by the developers , which Rubin described as a logic flaw , an Object Injection , a double SQL injection , and an overly permissive administrative dashboard . The logic issue stems from <S1> the reimplementation of a certain function without taking into account decisions made by the original function 's developers </S1> . According to the researcher , it is the result of <S3> `` <S4> having too much code , too many developers and lacking documentation </S4> .",

The Department of Homeland Security said it received reports of 59 cyber incidents at energy facilities last year , up nearly a third from the year before . <S0> The agency responsible for protecting the nation from cybercrime </S0> said it worked to mitigate 290 incidents last year across more than a dozen industries that rely on computer controls to run industrial sites , including manufacturing sites , power generation facilities , refineries , chemical plants and nuclear facilities . It found more than a quarter of these intrusions originated from so-called spear phishing emails that hackers use to trick people into downloading infected attachments or clicking on virus-laden links . More than one in 10 came from network probing and scanning . `` Every year , adversaries develop increasingly sophisticated attacks against control system networks , '' Homeland Security 's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team said .",

Unfortunately , <S2> Microsoft won ' t patch the flaw </S2> because <S6> they stopped supporting Windows Server 2003 a few years ago </S6> ( IIS 6.0 was in the OS ) . There are a little over 600,000 publicly accessible IIS 6.0 servers on the Internet , and most of them are probably running on Windows Server 2003 , according to a search of Shodan . <S1> The risk of exploitation </S1> can end up mitigated by disabling the WebDAV service on the vulnerable IIS 6.0 installation </S0> , but not all administrators will want to do it .

The items used in the email are Battlepaw an in-game pet , and a flying mount called Mystic Runesaber . Both these items are legitimate and can be bought in the game , which makes these emails more believable , but of course , it ' s all just a lie . Once you click the email , a new window will appear asking you to enter the login details of your blizzard account , and if you do that , <S0> the hacker will receive your information </S0> , which can either be sold or used personally . You are receiving this e-mail because your friend has purchased World of Warcraft In-Game Pet : Brightpaw for you as a gift !

Russia 's alleged use of computer hacking to interfere with the U.S. presidential election fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade . <S0> Cyberattacks in Ukraine , Bulgaria , Estonia , Germany , France and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Russian hackers appeared aimed at <S1> influencing election results </S1> , <S2> sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that included government agencies , the media and elected officials </S2> . Those investigations bolster U.S. intelligence findings of Russian meddling to help elect Donald Trump , a conclusion the president-elect has disputed ' although he conceded Friday after a private intelligence briefing that Russia was among the possible hacking culprits . They ' ve been very good at using the West ' s weaknesses against itself , the open Internet to hack , the free media to sow discord , and to cause people to question the underpinnings of the systems under which they live , said Hannah Thoburn , a research fellow at the Hudson Institute , a Washington think tank .",

Discovered by cybersecurity researchers at Barracuda Networks , this airline phishing attack uses a variety of techniques to capture sensitive data from victims and deploy an advanced persistent threat .

The email 's subject line claims it 's a forwarded message about a flight confirmation , stating the airline , the destination , and the price of the flight .

Designated CVE-2017-7269 , that ' s bad news , but the fact that it has been known about for months with new exploits now likely is the main takeaway . Given that <S1> IIS 6.0 shipped with Windows Server 2003 R2 in 2005 </S1> and <S2> Microsoft stopped supporting it after the end of life deadline passed in July 2015 ( ie no more patches ) </S2> , one might assume that the install base is small . More likely , this is another version of the Windows XP situation where organisations find it hard to wean themselves off core software and end up putting themselves at risk .

The security flaws are living inside Tizen , an operating system Samsung ( SSNLF ) has been developing over the last several years that runs on the company ' s televisions , smartwatches , and some low-powered mobile devices . Hackers with knowledge of the vulnerabilities can be half a world away but connect over the Internet to a Samsung television or wearable , and assume complete control over the device . Neiderman didn ' t say if hackers have been exploiting some of the flaws built into Tizen , and he has only been analyzing the software for the past eight months .",

Thirty-two percent of respondents said their company had been infected with ransomware with 11 percent taking longer than a week to regain access to their systems after an attack . According to CNN , in 2016 , the FBI estimated that ransomware would be a $ 1 billion a year crime . More than half ( 59 percent ) of those surveyed said that the cost of downtime due to lack of access to systems for customers and employees was the biggest business impact of a ransomware attack . Twenty-nine percent said that if their company suffered a ransomware attack which resulted in <S1> downtime </S0> , they would be losing between $ 5,000 and $ 20,000 a day </S1> . Twenty-seven percent thought that the amount could be over $ 20,000 a day .",

Presenting at the Security Analyst Summit ( SAS ) held these days in St. Maarten , Kaspersky Lab researchers said crooks broke into the networks of various banks using various exploits , where they used legitimate Windows tools and PowerShell malware to escalate their access to nearby systems .

The vulnerability affected all Windows versions , either 32 or 64 bits , and was reported and later described in more detail by Laurent Gaffi' ( @ PythonResponder ) the same day that the fix was published . He also published proof-of-concept ( PoC ) code triggering the vulnerability .

Unlike most document-related vulnerabilities , this zero-day bug that has yet to be patched does n't rely on macros -- in which <S1> Office typically warns users of risks when opening macro-enabled files </S1> . Instead , <S2> the vulnerability is triggered when <S4> a victim opens a trick Word document , which downloads a malicious HTML application from a server , disguised to look like a Rich Text document file as a decoy </S4> . <S3> The HTML application meanwhile downloads and runs a malicious script that can be used to stealthily install malware </S3> . Researchers at McAfee , who first reported the discovery on Friday , said because the HTML application is executable , the attacker can run code on the affected computer while evading memory-based mitigations designed to prevent these kinds of attacks . The issue relates to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding ( OLE ) function , which allows an application to link and embed content to other documents , according to researchers .",

His investigation discovered that <S0> this flaw was present in the firmware of DVRs manufactured by Chinese company TVT </S0> . Unfortunately , this was n't any DVR manufacturer , but a seller of white-label products , meaning <S2> other vendors purchased the DVRs from TVT , slapped their logo on top , and sold them to their own customers as separate products </S2> . In total , Kerner tracked the sloppy-coded DVR firmware to 70 other DVR vendors . Despite numerous contact attempts , Kerner was unable to get in contact with the company , meaning the vulnerability remained unpatched . With exploit code publicly available , it did n't take long for attackers to target TVT-based DVRs . This was easy because all they had to do was to ping random IPs and listen to a server response for the terms `` Cross Web Server .",

During our research , we observed the IPs related to the Godzilla Botnet loader serving payloads associated with exploits for the latest zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Office . <S0> Microsoft has said that the vulnerability will be patched today </S0> . Netskope Threat Protection detects the known exploits for this new vulnerability as Backdoor.Explot.ANWK . The payload for the exploit are detected as Backdoor.Generckd.4818242 and Backdoor.Generckd.4818381 . This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to execute a Visual Basic script , when the victim opens a document containing an embedded exploit . An excerpt of the VBScript code embedded in the document is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : VBScript code in the malicious document We observed the domains btt5sxcx90.com , hyoeyeep.ws and rottastics36w.net also serving payloads associated with the latest Microsoft Office zero-day exploit . At this moment we can not speculate that the spam campaign and zero-day are related . However , based on current observations , we believe that the same attack group is behind these attacks .",

We scanned the link with VirusTotal , and most of the security solutions found it to be clean , with the exception of a less well known scanner , AutoShun . Clicking on the website itself will take you to a simple page , where the main focus falls on a form for uploading your CV . Your CV contains a wealth of personal data which a cybercriminal uses to make a profit at your expense . Phone numbers can be sold for companies doing promotional cold calling .

The flaw was discovered by researchers from security consultancy DefenseCode and is located in a feature that retrieves preview images for videos hosted on Vimeo . Such videos can be added to product listings in Magento . <S4> The DefenseCode researchers determined that if the image URL points to a different file , for example a PHP script </S4> , <S3> Magento will download the file in order to validate it </S3> . If the file is not an image , <S2> the platform will return a `` Disallowed file type '' error </S1> , but wo n't actually remove it from the server </S2> . An attacker with access to exploit this flaw could achieve remote code execution by first tricking Magento to download an .htaccess configuration file that enables PHP execution inside the download directory and then downloading the malicious PHP file itself . Once on the server , the PHP script can act as a backdoor and can be accessed from an external location by pointing the browser to it .",

According Bosko Stankovic , information security engineer at DefenseCode , despite repeated efforts to notify Magento , which began in November 2016 , the vulnerability remains unpatched despite four version updates since the disclosure . DefenseCode did not examine Magento Enterprise , the commercial version of the platform , but warns both share the same underlying vulnerable code .",

This SMS-based management feature allows Aga users to turn ovens on or off from remote locations by sending an SMS to their device . In this scenario , an attacker would need a victim 's oven SMS number , but Pen Test Partners researchers say the web-based administration panel contains flaws that allow attackers to scrape for all active SIM card numbers assigned to Aga ovens .

This method adds another set of techniques cybercriminals can use to evade anti-analysis and sandbox settings and to successfully infect computer systems , the company said . The threatening documents employ a similar look and feel to Microsoft Office documents using macro elements for malware delivery , but they do not feature the distinctive enable macros banner , PhishMe said .

In a notice published to its site on Friday the company said a second breach occurred at select hotels between Sept. 29 and Dec. 29 last year .

To spread ransomware , hackers will often rely on spam emails with an attachment or a link to a website that contains malicious coding .

More specifically <S1> the bod alleges that Edge exposes the URL of any JavaScript Fetch response </S1> , in contradiction to the specification . This is a problem because <S3> it 's possible to identify netizens by crafting a fetch request in a webpage that will redirect to a URL containing the visitor 's username </S3> ( e.g . requesting https : //facebook.com/me will pull in https : //facebook.com/username ) . Zelivansky alerted Microsoft but <S4> the software giant said the issue was not a security problem </S4> . El Reg also prodded Redmond only to be told the tech giant had nothing to add beyond its response to Zelivansky . The researcher went public with his findings and tipped off The Reg earlier this month after Redmond decided the issue did n't merit a security fix . <S2> The privacy shortcoming has spawned a discussion thread on Reddit </S2> .",

The Shadow Brokers made news back in August when they dumped hacking tools for routers and firewall products that they claimed came from the Equation Group , a top cyberespionage team that some suspect works for the NSA . Those tools contained several previously unknown and valuable exploits , lending credibility to the hacking group 's claims , according to security researchers . The Shadow Brokers ' latest dump includes 61 files , many of which have never been seen by security firms before , said Jake Williams , founder of Rendition InfoSec , a security provider . He ' s been examining the tools , and said it ' ll take time to verify their capabilities . His initial view is that they ' re designed for detection evasion . For instance , one of the tools is built to edit Windows event logs .",

HipChat did n't say how many users may have been affected by the incident . <S3> The passwords that may have been exposed would also be difficult to crack </S3> , the company said . The data is hashed , or obscured , with the bcrypt algorithm , which transforms the passwords into a set of random-looking characters . For added security , HipChat `` salted '' each password with a random value before hashing it . HipChat warned that chat room data including the room name and topic may have also been exposed . But no financial or credit information was taken , the company said .",

To coin a phrase , all serious flaws are serious but some are more serious than others . This one matters for two reasons , only one of which will sound flippant : it wasn ' t discovered by Tavis Ormandy , who at times has seemed to be writing a novella on flaw-hunting with the company ' s name on it . Another researcher with a taste for LastPass , researcher Martin Vigo , uncovered the latest issue , and it ' s the 2FA bit of the story that explains the angst . Two-factor authentication ( a term that also refers to more convenient but less secure two-step verification ) matters because it is the crown jewels of everyday security , especially for <S2> password managers </S2> such as <S1> LastPass </S1> .",

SNMP is used for automated network device identification , monitoring and remote configuration . It is supported and enabled by default in many devices , including servers , printers , networking hubs , switches and routers . Independent researchers Ezequiel Fernandez and Bertin Bervis recently found a way to bypass SNMP authentication on 78 models of cable modems that ISPs from around the world have provided to their customers . Their internet scans revealed hundreds of thousands of devices whose configurations could be changed remotely through the SNMP weakness that they found and dubbed StringBleed . The leaking of sensitive configuration data through the default `` public '' SNMP community string is a known problem that has affected many devices over the years . The two researchers first located a small number of vulnerable devices , including the Cisco DPC3928SL cable modem that 's now part of Technicolor 's product portfolio following <S1> the company 's acquisition of Cisco 's Connected Devices division in 2015 </S1> .",

The teaser was a blue box that said , Open in Docs. In reality , the link led to a dummy app that asked users for permission to access their Gmail account . An example of the phishing email that circulated on Tuesday . Users might easily have been fooled , because <S1> the dummy app was actually named Google Docs. It also asked for access to Gmail through Google ' s actual login service </S1> . The hackers were able to pull off the attack by <S3> abusing the OAuth protocol </S3> , a way for internet accounts at Google , Twitter , Facebook and other services to connect with third-party apps . The OAuth protocol doesn ' t transfer any password information , but instead uses special access tokens that can open account access .

The issue , tracked via the CVE-2017-8295 identifier , affects all WordPress versions and is related to how WordPress sites put together the password reset emails . According to Golunski , an attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request that triggers a tainted password reset operation by injecting a custom SERVER_NAME variable , such as `` attacker-domain.com '' . This means that <S3> when the WordPress site puts together the password reset email , the `` From '' and `` Return-Path '' values will be in the form of `` wordpress @ attacker-domain.com '' </S3> .",

Researcher Dawid Golunski of Legal Hackers disclosed the vulnerability on Wednesday via his new ExploitBox service . All versions of WordPress , including the latest , 4.7.4 , are vulnerable , the researcher said . The vulnerability ( CVE-2017-8295 ) happens because <S2> WordPress uses what Golunski calls untrusted data by default when it creates a password reset email </S2> . In a proof-of-concept writeup , Golunski points out that <S1> WordPress uses a variable , SERVER_NAME , to get the hostname to create a From/Return-Path header for the password reset email </S1> . Since that variable , by its nature , can be customized , an attacker could insert a domain of his choosing and make it so an outgoing email could be sent to a malicious address , the researcher says . The attacker would then receive the reset email and be able to change the account password and take over .",

It does so by enforcing application whitelisting , full hard disk encryption , providing ACL-based control of process execution and resource access , enforcing security policies , restricting attempts to connect peripheral devices , and so on . <S3> The found flaw can be exploited to <S2> remotely run code on a targeted ATM </S3> , increase the attacker ' s privileges in the system , and <S1> compromise the machine completely </S1> . To exploit the vulnerability , a criminal would need to pose as the control server , which is possible via ARP spoofing , or by simply connecting the ATM to a criminal-controlled network connection , researcher Georgy Zaytsev explained . During the process of generating the public key for traffic encryption , the rogue server can cause <S5> a buffer overflow on the ATM </S5> due to failure on the client side to limit the length of response parameters and send a command for remote code execution .",

As Ars reported Monday , the authentication bypass vulnerability resides in a feature known as Active Management Technology . AMT , as it 's usually called , allows system administrators to perform a variety of powerful tasks over a remote connection . Among the capabilities : changing the code that boots up computers , accessing the computer 's mouse , keyboard , and monitor , loading and executing programs , and remotely powering on computers that are turned off . In short , <S4> AMT makes it possible to log into a computer and exercise the same control enjoyed by administrators with physical access </S4> . <S3> AMT , which is available with many vPro processors , was set up to require a password before it could be remotely accessed over a Web browser interface </S3> .",

The worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. By Monday night , Microsoft had released an emergency patch , along with details of what the vulnerability entailed . And yes , <S4> it was every bit as scary as advertised </S4> . That ' s not only because of the extent of the damage hackers could have done , or the range of devices the bug affected . It ' s because <S3> the bug 's fundamental nature underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in the very features meant to keep our devices safe </S3> . What made this particular bug so insidious was that <S5> it would have allowed hackers to target Windows Defender , an antivirus system that Microsoft builds directly into its operating system </S5> .

It was all a pack of lies , of course , as became obvious if you clicked through to the various links seen in the scam campaign . When we used an old-model iPhone , we were bait-and-switched to what was supposedly a lucky draw in which we could allegedly win a brand new iPhone in return for forwarding the original scam to four of our friends and four groups of friends : We didn ' t do that , of course , so we can ' t tell you what we would have had to do next to qualify for entry into the prize draw , but most scams of this sort involve getting you to fill in one or more surveys , in which you hand over personal information such as email address , phone number and often your physical address .",

Apple implemented the function in September , in the weeks leading up to the release of the game Super Mario Run . The function takes information from the device , such iCloud credentials or devicename values , to alert users when a soon-to-launch application debuts . Mejri , the firm ' s founder , claims the Notify functionality can be exploited via a persistent input validation vulnerability and mail encoding web vulnerability . An attacker could substitute the name variable'the vulnerable firstname parameter'with a script launching a payload . Mejri said the issue stems from how Apple sends notifications from its @ new-itunes.com web server ; which doesn ' t properly validate the iCloud name or devicename parameter .",

We are calling this the CloudPhishing Fan-out Effect . In this blog , we will detail the insidious nature of CloudPhishing and the secondary fan-out using two recently detected cases . We will also illustrate how an attack even if unsuccessful may leave the target vulnerable to future attacks . Additionally , we will outline the Netskope protection stance , and general best practices to handle this attack . The CloudPhishing fan-out effect occurs when a victim inadvertently shares the phishing document with colleagues , whether internal or external , via a cloud service .",

HospitalGown is a vulnerability to data exposure caused , not by any code in the app , but by the app developers ' failure to properly secure the backend servers with which the app communicates , wrote the authors of the report released Wednesday .

They found they could bypass detection rules recommended by governments and antivirus vendors , says RiskSense senior security researcher Sean Dillon . This version of EternalBlue , an exploit initially released by Shadow Brokers earlier this year , does not use the DoublePulsar payload common among other exploits leaked by the hacker group .

The breach occurred between Aug 10 , 2016 to Feb 9 , 2017 , according to GameStop . In April , the company publicly acknowledged the breach . But , it wasn ' t until last week that affected customers were individually notified that their cards were likely stolen . I ' m pretty upset at GameStop . I should have been notified when they knew about it in April , said GameStop customer Ryan Duff , a former cyber operations tactician at U.S. Cyber Command .

In short , <S4> CashCrate connects users to companies that need people to test new products and services </S4> , or take part in daily surveys in exchange for cash . The data includes user email addresses , names , passwords , and physical addresses . Judging by timestamps in the stolen database , the earliest accounts date way back to 2006 , and come with full passwords . If a user signed up to another service with the same password , <S3> hackers could access the victim 's account on another site , as well as their CashCrate account </S3> . <S0> Accounts from mid 2010 onwards appear to have passwords hashed with the notoriously weak MD5 algorithm </S0> , meaning that <S1> hackers may be able to crack the hashes and obtain the real login credentials </S1> .

As of now , NAYANA has not received the keys to decrypt their files despite having paid three parts of the ransom . The fourth one , which is allegedly the last installment , is yet to be paid . However , according to NAYANA , the attackers claimed to provide the key after three payments . According to Trend Micro ' s report , Erebus was originally found back in September 2016 . At the time , the malware was not that harmful and was being distributed through malware-containing advertisements .

That ' s according to Perry Stoneman , Global Head of Utilities at consulting firm Capgemini , who told ELN it would likely take the form of a ransomware attack . This is when computer systems are hacked by criminals who then demand a sum of money to avoid a major city having its power cut off . Mr Stoneman believes the hackers would want their attack to be visible , attention-catching and newsworthy turning the lights out is just that . He said : It could be something more malicious than just wanting money . Mr Stoneman told ELN although the risks do increase as energy systems become more dependent on technology , the main reason the threat is growing is because <S0> there are larger numbers of hackers with more advanced skills than ever before </S0> .",

But the doomsday scenario never materialized and you don ' t even seem to hear much about it anymore . In this blog post , part 1 of 2 , I will explore this idea and try to understand why the CSRF giant never awoke . First we ' ll cover the overall threat landscape , trends , and some notable CSRF exploits throughout the years , including one from personal experience . As a quick review , CSRF exists because <S0> web applications trust the cookies sent by web browsers within an HTTP request </S0> . In a CSRF attack , the attacker causes a victim ' s browser to make a request that results in a change or action which benefits the attacker ( and/or harms the victim ) in some way . Without a specific defense like a random token in the request body that is validated on the server side CSRF attacks are possible .",

Ransomware for Android phones has already been around for several years and <S0> security experts have warned in the past that it 's only a matter of time until such malicious programs start affecting smart TVs </S0> , especially since some of them also run Android . In November 2015 , a Symantec researcher named Candid Wueest even went as far as to infect his own TV with an Android ransomware application to highlight the threat . While that infection was just a demonstration , this Christmas , the owner of an LG Electronics TV experienced the real deal . Kansas-based software developer Darren Cauthon reported on Twitter on Dec. 25 that a family member accidentally infected his Android-based TV with ransomware after downloading a movie-watching app . The picture shared by Cauthon showed the TV screen with an FBI-themed ransom message . On Android the majority of ransomware applications are so-called screen lockers . They work by displaying persistent messages on the phone 's screen and preventing users from performing any other actions on their devices .",

And though the number of people adding code to the project has grown since last we checked , <S2> the project missed its recent January report to the Apache Foundation </S2> . The upshot is : security holes are n't being patched , it seems . The issue , identified by security researcher Alex Inf'hr , is that there 's a way to achieve remote code execution by triggering an event embedded in an ODT ( OpenDocument Text ) file . In a blog post on Friday , Inf'hr explains how he found a way to abuse the OpenDocument scripting framework by adding an onmouseover event to a link in an ODT file . The event , which fires when a user 's mouse pointer moves over the link , can traverse local directories and execute a local Python script .",

The flaw could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to industrial networks and ultimately <S2> put operations and production at risk </S2> . The SCALANCE S firewall is used to protect secure industrial networks from untrusted network traffic , and allows filtering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways . <S4> Siemens S602 , S612 , S623 , S627-2M SCALANCE devices with software versions prior to V4.0.1.1 are impacted </S4> . Researchers with Applied Risk , who discovered the flaw , said that vulnerability exists in the web server of the firewall software . An attacker can carry out the attack by crafting a malicious link and tricking an administrator who is logged into the web server to click that link . Once an admin does so , the attacker can execute commands on the web server , on the administrator ' s behalf .",

The Connecticut-based charity organization fell for the ruse , conducted in May 2017 , and approved the transfer of close to $ 1 million to an entity in Japan which was used as a front to rake in the proceeds .

The ransomware , in a note written in both English and Chinese , has threatened to turn off the mining unit ' s fan and compromise its overheating protection and by extension , the safety and integrity of the mining unit . To remove the ransomware , the culprit behind the strain has demanded either a ransom of 10 BTC to be paid or a malicious software that could potentially infect thousands be downloaded by the victim . Although nobody is sure how these mining rigs came to be infected , it has been suggested by some that tainted rig firmware may have been the culprit .",

According to a report posted by Shodan , <S1> the Heartbleed vulnerability first exposed in April 2014 was still found in 199,594 internet-accessible devices </S1> during a scan it performed last weekend . But according to open-source security firm Black Duck , about 11 % of more than 200 applications it audited between Oct 2015 and March 2016 contained the flaw , which <S2> enables a buffer overread that endangers data from clients and servers running affected versions of OpenSSL </S2> . The company ' s vice president of security strategy Mike Pittenger says it ' s likely most of those machines have been remediated , but it doesn ' t address the countless other applications commercial and proprietary - Black Duck didn ' t audit . However , I would not extrapolate that to say 11 % of all commercial applications were vulnerable to Heartbleed at that time . That 11 % is a number from the company ' s last published report .",

The bug is exploitable remotely if the remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the router over LAN or WLAN , he explained . When trying to access the web panel a user is asked to authenticate , if the authentication is cancelled and password recovery is not enabled , the user is redirected to a page which exposes a password recovery token . If a user supplies the correct token to the page http : //router/passwordrecovered.cgi ? id=TOKEN ( and password recovery is not enabled ) , they will receive the admin password for the router . He discovered the vulnerability almost a year ago , but revealed it only now because <S1> Netgear has been slow to push out fixed firmware for affected devices </S1> .",

The attack apparently compromised the confidentiality '' of its IT network and <S0> put its integrity at risk </S0> . Although there ' s no obvious official statement up on the OSCE site , spokeswoman Mersiha Causevic Podzic told the newswire that the way in which the attacker accessed the OSCE was identified , as have some of the external communication destinations . There are rumors , emanating from a Western intelligence agency , that <S1> the notorious Russian hacking group APT28 is behind the attack </S1> .

Dan Tentler , founder of cybersecurity firm Phobos Group , who discovered the vulnerable hosts , warned the flaws are so easy to find that he believes he was probably not the first person to find them . `` It 's very likely that these servers are being exploited in the wild , '' he told me on the phone . While <S1> the Pentagon is said to be aware of the vulnerable servers </S1> , it has yet to implement any fixes -- more than eight months after the department was alerted .

This sort of attack can be conducted by any party within Wi-Fi range of your device while it is in use , Strafach said . This can be anywhere in public , or even within your home if an attacker can get within close range .

It 's not clear what the malware 's end goal is , but in at least one case it was used to exfiltrate data from a bank 's computer to an external server . The nature of the stolen information could not be immediately determined because it was encrypted , Polish IT news blog Zaufana Trzecia Strona reported Friday . After the malware program is downloaded and executed on a computer , it connects to remote servers and can be used to perform network reconnaissance , lateral movement and data exfiltration , the BadCyber researchers said in a blog post . The malware is similar to other crimeware tools , but has not been documented before .",

The big difference was that instead of targeting financial services companies , <S2> phishers increasingly targeted cloud storage service providers like Google and DropBox </S2> , security vendor PhishLabs said in a voluminous report on phishing trends released this week . Compared to 2013 , when barely 10 % of phishing attacks targeted cloud storage services , about 22.5 % of phishing attacks last year involved such companies . That was just barely below the 23 % of phishing scams involving financial brands , the company noted . What that means is that <S1> users are likely going to get more phishing emails this year trying to get them to part with credentials to their cloud storage credentials </S1> . `` Over the last four years , the number of phishing attacks targeting cloud storage services has skyrocketed , '' says Crane Hassold , senior security threat researcher at PhishLabs .",

The RPZ mechanism is used by Domain Name System recursive resolvers to allow for the customized handling of the resolution of collections of domain name information . Versions 9.8.8 , 9.9.3-S1 , 9.9.3 , 9.9.10b1 , 9.10.0 , and 9.10.5b1 , 9.11.0 are all considered vulnerable , according to the ISC . When servers use both mechanisms simultaneously , a vulnerability ( CVE-2017-3135 ) that stems from query processing could result in an inconsistent state , triggering either <S3> an INSIST assertion failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer </S3> , according to a security advisory published Wednesday .",

Because <S0> the actors in this case are relying on paid , targeted ads on Twitter </S0> , <S1> users don ' t need to do anything to see the phishing link </S1> . <S3> Attackers are increasing the sophistication of social engineering approaches and extending them across social channels </S3> . <S2> Users and brands need to be increasingly savvy to avoid getting snared by ads , accounts , and messages that initially look legitimate </S2> . While this attack was observed on Twitter , such a scam could be implemented on any social media platform that implements some form of account verification . The full blog post can be found here , however key takeouts include : Verified accounts are a powerful tool on Twitter to help brands differentiate themselves from fraudulent , impersonation , and parody accounts on the social media site . When an account is officially verified , it displays a special badge intended to reassure Twitter users that they are interacting with a genuine brand and not an impostor .",

Public charging ports are installed almost everywhere for the users and vicitors convenience such as at airports , conference centers , cafes , parks and planes , etc .

However , Drew Paik from IT security security firm Authentic8 told CNN that this is a very dangerous thing to do because <S4> the outlet might be hacked </S4> and <S3> all the data present in your phone could easily be transferred to a hacker </S3> . Authentic8 is the developer of Silo web browser that facilitates anonymous web surfing .

To wit , <S0> last week researchers at the security firm ESET spotted new ransomware - Filecoder.E - circulating via BitTorrent , disguised as a `` patcher '' that purports to allow Mac users to crack such applications as Adobe Premiere Pro CC and Microsoft Office 2016 </S0> . As Toronto-based security researcher Cheryl Biswas notes in a blog post : `` For those who torrent , be careful . ESET says the ransomware can also encrypt any Time Machine backups on network-connected volumes that are mounted at the time of the attack . If the ransomware infects a system , it demands 0.25 bitcoins - currently worth about $ 300 - for a decryption key .",

On Tuesday , Spiral Toys said the breach , which affects 800,000 user accounts , only came to its attention last week on Feb 22 . One researcher named Victor Gevers began contacting the toymaker about the problem in late December , when he noticed that a company MongoDB database storing customer information was publicly exposed . <S0> Gevers has even documented his efforts to contact Spiral Toys , which involved email , sending a message to its CEO over a LinkedIn invite , and working with a journalist from Vice Media to try and warn the company about the breach </S0> . Despite those attempts , he never received a response . <S1> The breach </S1> only managed to grab headlines on Monday when another security researcher named Troy Hunt blogged about it . The toys in question , which are sold under the CloudPets brand , can allow parents and their children to send voice messages through the stuffed animals over the internet .",

Attackers could employ the issues found to maliciously spy via the robot ' s microphone and camera , leak personal or business data , and in extreme cases , cause serious physical harm or damage to people and property in the vicinity of a hacked robot . There ' s no doubt that robots and the application of Artificial Intelligence have become the new norm and the way of the future , said Cesar Cerrudo , CTO at IOActive . Robots will soon be everywhere from toys to personal assistants to manufacturing workers the list is endless .

In a review of 10 robots , which ranged from home , business , and industrial , IOActive said the risks ranged from insecure communications , authentication issues , weak cryptography and missing authorization . Cesar Cerrudo , CTO of IOActive Labs , said robots suffer from many of the same security shortcomings of as IoT , medical devices , smart cars and plush toys . We found nearly 50 cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the robot ecosystem components , many of which were common problems , according to the IOActive Labs report . As part of its investigation , IOActive analyzed some robot hardware as well as robot ecosystems . Some of the robots examined included SoftBank Robotics ' NAO and Pepper robots , UBTECH Robotics ' Alpha 1S and Alpha 2 robots and Rethink Robotics ' Baxter and <S2> Sawyer robots </S2> .",

A `` vast majority '' of Cloudflare 's customers also did not appear to have had any of their data leaked . Cloudflare ' s inspection of tens of thousands of pages that were leaked from its reverse-proxy servers and cached by search engines revealed a `` large number '' of instances of internal Cloudflare cookies and headers .
