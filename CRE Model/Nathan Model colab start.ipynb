we need all the losses and no TF for eval and th etraining limits to arodun 40%\n","#it like neg sampling through, seems to be beneficial to model training in all scenarios, delays overfitting and gives better control of P/R\n","\n","#separating berts for span and rel may help a bit, but do not really change the fundamental issues\n","\n","\n","#basicalyl using loose matching helps the F1 for spans get up to arodun 75 for spans and 50 for rels, but the results are somewhat unstable\n","#this is somewhat interesting though, at least for the spans, the rels are still quite garbage though, obviously there is more to the causal stuff\n","#using token tagging seems to give slightly better F1 accross the board, but hte lost rels in teh eval are more than the binary filtering, weird, maybe it doesn't matter if the matching is loose!!!\n","#add cls to rel reps\n","\n","\n","#try removing cls and width embeddings from span reps\n","#try changing to FFN projection\n","\n","\n","#teh cosine
