# Causal Relation Extraction

This work investigates the capacity of lightweight, span-based discriminative models to capture event-level causality directly from raw text. It also introduces auxiliary mechanisms, such as pruning, consistency enforcement, and custom span representations, to mitigate structural prediction errors and improve robustness under noisy supervision.
